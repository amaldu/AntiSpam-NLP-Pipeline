# Objective

This project presents a step-by-step guide to build an e-mail spam classification model.

# About the data
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email) which consists of 5,574 messages with the following columns: 

1. ***Category*** column with the following labels:

- HAM: real e-mails we want the filter to land our inbox
- SPAM: spam/scam em-amils that we want to send directly to the spam folder

2. ***Message*** column with a list of messages without any type of format

# Research

## EDA
[Notebook](https://github.com/AMaldu/spam_detector/blob/main/research/eda.ipynb)
1. Analysis of basic information about the dataset.

4. Basic viz of features.    

## Preprocessing

[Notebook](https://github.com/AMaldu/spam_detector/blob/main/research/preprocessing.ipynb)
2. Change data types for more memory efficiency and data integrity.
3. Removal of duplicates.
1. Change of data types
2. Drop duplicates
3. Chars cleaning. Based on this [Notebook](https://github.com/AMaldu/spam_detector/blob/main/research/special_chars_analysis.ipynb)
    1. Replacement of special replacements  
    2. Replacement of emojis
    3. Conversion to lowecase
    4. Removal of HTML tags
    5. Removal of URLs
    6. Replacement of numbers with "number"
    7. Replacement of e-mail addresses with "emailaddr"
    8. Removal of punctutation
    9. Removal of Non-Alphabetic Characters
    10. Collapse of multiple whitespaces into single whitespace

4. Tokenization
5. Removal of stopwords
6. Lemmatization





# Experimentation
This section only contains results. If you want to take a look at the Decision-Making Process please take a look at the Experimentation [README file](https://github.com/AMaldu/spam_detector/blob/main/experiments/EXPERIMENTS_GUIDELINE.md) 
1. Base model BOW + Multinomial Naive Bayes


Classification Report (Test):
                 
                  precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.97      0.98       453
           1       0.82      0.95      0.88        63

    accuracy                           0.97       516
    macro avg      0.91      0.96      0.93       516
    weighted avg   0.97      0.97      0.97       516

- Recall 0.95: the model is detecting a 95% of the class 1

- Precision 0.82: lower than we would like to because there is a significative number of False Positives

- F1-score 0.88: decent value but since recall is high and precission not that much there is room for improvement.
